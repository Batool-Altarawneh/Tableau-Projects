This project showcases **interactive Tableau dashboards** that analyze sales and customer performance.  
The dashboards were designed to support **sales managers, executives, and marketing teams** by providing clear insights into KPIs, trends, and customer behavior.

## Project Overview
The project includes two dashboards:

1. **Sales Dashboard**
   - Provides an overview of **Total Sales, Profit, and Quantity**.
   - Visualizes **monthly and weekly performance trends**.
   - Highlights best/worst performing months.
   - Compares **subcategories by sales & profit**.

2. **Customer Dashboard**
   - Provides insights into **Total Customers, Orders, and Sales per Customer**.
   - Displays **customer distribution by number of orders**.
   - Identifies **Top 10 Customers by Profit** with rank, orders, sales, and last order date.

## Data Modeling & Transformations
To achieve these dashboards, I created several **calculated fields** and **parameters** in Tableau:

- **Year-over-Year Comparison Fields**
  - Calculated fields to compare KPIs.

- **Dynamic Year Parameter**
  - Parameter allowing users to switch between years.
  - Enables historical comparison across KPIs.

- **Customer Segmentation**
  - Distribution fields to group customers by number of orders.
  - Ranking functions to identify top 10 customers.
